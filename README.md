Chibi's Canvas Space Invaders
=============================

A Canvas Space Invaders "lite" game, this game is not that hard and should not be seen as a seriously replica of space invaders.
It's just a try to do something like a lite-version of Space Invaders with Javascript and Canvas.

Feal free build som real of it, if you do I hope you send me a message!

Install instructions
--------------------

### 1. Just put files where you want them.

### 2. Modify how many levels and aliens per level:
* If you change canvas heigth, level will increase up to 760px (max level 12, with 15 types of aliens) or decrease if make heigth lower.
* If you change canvas width, it will increase or decrease.
* I have max test 760x1200px, not really try decrease that much. Increasing may slow browser down alot...
